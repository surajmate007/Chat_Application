# Chat_Application
This project implements Chat Application in Python

How to run this code:
1. First run the server.py file.
2. Run client.py file and give input in format python3 client.py [username] [IP address].
3. Then the server will automatically register the client for both sending and receiving port.
4. After registering multiple users one of the user which will behave like sender will put the name of the receiver to send the message. The format is like:                @[username]: [content of the message]
5. Once the message is created it will be sent by pressing the enter key. The message will reach to receivers terminal.
